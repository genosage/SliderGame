1. Code Structure
The code for calculating the legal moves is written in bottom-up approach. The
core methods in it are isOutOfBound, isLegal, legalMoves and allLegalMoves. In
the very beginning, the isOutOfBound method is implemented to check whether an
index is out of bound of the board array. It is then used in isLegal method,
which takes a before and an after position on the board and checks whether this
move is legal. Then legalMoves method uses isLegal to calculate all legal moves
for a specific piece on the board. Finally, the allLegalMoves method to
calculate all the legal moves for a specific player can be easily implemented. 

2. Algorithm Summary
The enumeration algorithm is used in this project. For a board like following:

H +
+ V

It will be transformed to String[] board = {"H", "+", "+", "V"}. The code will
go through this array to calculate the legal moves.

3. Time Complexity
The time complexity of the code is O(dimension * dimension) since it uses the
enumeration algorithm.
